# Ketchup (pomodoro timer) Spec
- A pomodoro timer which will function as an active timer and a scheduling tool...
- A pomodoro timer is a functional split/interval timer. The user defines the intervals and how often they repeat.
- So at a minumum, we need the following data:
  - Pomodoro time
  - short break time
  - long break time
  - number of pomodoros
- When all of the above is collected, do:
  - Display amount of work & rest time
  - Total length of session
  - Execute timer (special pause feature, offset? total time distracted?)
